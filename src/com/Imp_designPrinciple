design principle
1. Principle of least knowledge (also k/a )
Talk to immediate friends

According to the principle, only those methods should be invoked which belong to
1. object itself
2. object passed as a parameter to method
3. Component of the object
4. any object that the method creates

so,

Class A {
	
	Object point3;
	
	void method(Object point2) {
	
		 point2.method() ///correct
		 point3.method() //correct
		 Object point4 = new Object();
		 point4.method() //correct
		 
		 Object wrongWay = getMeAnObject();
		 wrongWay.method() ///wrong
	 
	 
    }
}

2. Null object pattern
For eg. in Command pattern, we cab create a NULL object called NoCommand. This object wont perform anything....on execution of execute method.
But reduces the need of checking null everytime a command object is accessed
